            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p> l'm Darlyn Mae A. Evasco, a second-year college student pursuing a bachelor's 
                degree in Information Technology at Rizal Technological University. During my 
                junior and senior high school years, I excelled academically. It was during this 
                time that I gained extensive knowledge in drafting and illustration, transitioning 
                from manual to digital techniques. Since then, I have consistently worked hard 
                to further my education, aiming to become a better individual and student while 
                also preparing for my future career.<br></br>
                During my downtime, I ensure to dedicate time to practicing programming 
                skills. This commitment allows me to deepen what I've learned from my 
                professors and enhance my abilities in my chosen field. I believe that by 
                continuously honing these skills, I am preparing myself for a successful future career. </p>
